## 🧠 About Me

I like building things that mix software with real-world logic.  
Most of my projects start as curiosity, break multiple times, and eventually turn into something useful.

Currently focused on:
- Strengthening DSA and problem-solving
- Computer vision and signal-based projects
- Full-stack and mobile app development
- Learning how systems actually work under the hood

*Still learning. Still building. Still breaking things on purpose.*
